## Carbon what? (cont'd) 

* Voluntary carbon offsets (COs) are [tradable certificates linked to climate projects]{.alert}.    
    - Projects typically consist of reforestation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy interventions. 

* By purchasing COs, individuals and firms can fund the projects associated with them.

* [A huge market:]{.alert} in 2021, the voluntary carbon market reached $2 billion --- four times its value in 2020. The pace of purchases continued to accelerate in 2022.


## This paper

* So far, the literature has mainly focused on estimating individuals' willingness to pay for COs [e.g. @berger2022willingness; @rodemeier2023].

* The psychological factors influencing carbon offsetting behaviour are still poorly understood.

* We focus on two of these factors    
    - [Mental accounting]{.MA} ([MA]{.MA}): the cognitive bookkeeping process by which individuals evaluate their transactions.
    - [Strategic ignorance]{.SI} ([SI]{.SI}): people's deliberate avoidance of information that might cause them distress.

## Overview

*  Two pre-registered ([osf.io/9y3dj](https://osf.io/9y3dj)), incentivized online experiments (named [MA]{.MA} and [SI]{.SI}) conducted on Prolific. 

* [Sample:]{.alert} 1000 UK residents.    
    - 80% power with a 5% significance level to detect an effect size of about 0.25 using a two-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test 💪

* No deception.

* 1.5 GBP participation payment (~13.8 GBP/hour) + bonus payment (Ryanair/Amazon voucher worth up to 100 GBP).

## Overview (cont'd)

* Each experiment consisted of [three phases:]{.alert}    
    1. Random assignment to treatment conditions + survey.    
    2. Choice whether to contribute (and, if so, how much) to a carbon offset programme.    
    3. ~~Elicitation of attitudes towards two articles discussing the environmental impact of flying and e-commerce.~~


## Offsetting decisions

* CO contributions were made on a [voluntary basis]{.alert}. 

* Subjects were asked whether they would like to participate in a CO programme.

* Those willing to participate had to specify their desired contribution [within a range of 0.1 to 10 GBP]{.alert}, with intervals of 0.1 GBP.

* Participants were informed that contributions would be deducted from the bonus prize.    
    - An individual who contributed $x$ and was then selected to win the prize would receive a voucher worth $100 - x$ GBP.

## Offsetting decisions (cont'd)

* Contributions from subjects selected to win the bonus prize were transferred to [Trees for All]{.alert}, a non-profit organization that offsets CO2 emissions by planting trees around the world.

* Contributions from subjects not selected to win the bonus prize were not transferred.

* Thus, actual [contributions were contingent on winning the prize]{.alert} (incentive compatibility requirement).


## Treatments: [Study MA]{.MA}

* The reatments only differed in the bonus prize.

* [Two treatment conditions]{.alert}    
    1. [`Amazon_noinfo` (n = 200). Bonus prize: Amazon voucher.]{.fragment}
    2. [`Ryanair_noinfo` (n = 200): Bonus prize: Ryanair voucher.]{.fragment}

::: {.fragment}

* No information about the emissions associated with the bonus prize. 

:::

## Treatments: [Study SI]{.SI}

* The treatments differed in the information given to subjects when deciding whether to contribute to the CO programme.   

* [Three treatment conditions]{.alert}
    1. [`Ryanair_info` (n = 200). Subjects were given an estimate of the per-flight and per-passenger emissions associated with a 100 GBP Ryanair ticket.]{.fragment}

    ![](CGP_been_files/info_choice.png){.absolute bottom=0 left=250 .fragment .fade-in-then-out width=60%}

    2. [`Ryanair_noinfo` (n = 200). Subjects were not given any such information. Shared with [Study MA]{.MA}.]{.fragment}

    3. [`Ryanair_choose` (n = 400). Subjects could choose whether or not to be informed.]{.fragment}

<!-- ::: {.r-stack}
![](CGP_been_files/info_choice.png){.absolute bottom=50 left=250 .fragment .fade-in-then-out width=52%}
::: -->

## Treatments: [Study SI]{.SI} (cont'd)

* Subjects in `Ryanair_choose` sorted themselves into two sub-conditions, `Ryanair_choose_info` and `Ryanair_choose_noinfo`.

* Those who chose to receive information had to complete a real-effort decoding task.    
    <!-- - Goal: to mimic the effort required to find information on the environmental impact of flights, e.g. by searching the Internet. -->
* Subjects could quit the decoding task at any time, in which case they received no information.



## Treatments: overview

## Main hypotheses

* [Question:]{.alert} are contributions to the CO programme more likely to be allocated to the [same mental account]{.alert} as the Ryanair voucher than the Amazon voucher?   
    - [Conjecture:]{.alert} flying is perceived as more closely related to carbon offsetting than online shopping.

:::: {.callout-note icon=false}
# Hypothesis 1 ([Study MA]{.MA})

Subjects in `Ryanair_noinfo` contribute more to the CO programme than subjects in `Amazon_noinfo`.
::::


## Main hypotheses (cont'd)

* [Question:]{.alert} does increasing the [salience]{.alert} of the environmental impact of people's actions have a positive effect on contributions?    
    - [Conjecture:]{.alert} receiving information about the impact of flights raises sustainability concerns.


:::: {.callout-note icon=false}
# Hypothesis 2 ([Study SI]{.SI})

Subjects in `Ryanair_info` contribute more to the CO programme than subjects in `Ryanair_noinfo`.
::::


## Main hypotheses (cont'd)

* [Question:]{.alert} does the decision to receive information about the impact of flights affect offsetting behaviour?
    - [Conjecture:]{.alert} individuals with a low or moderate propensity to contribute choose not to receive information and donate little.
    - These individuals would feel compelled to donate more if they had the information. 
    - Thus, they [strategically choose to ignore the information]{.alert} in order to donate less and avoid cognitive dissonance [@benaboutirole:2016].


## Main hypotheses (cont'd)

<br>

:::: {.callout-note icon=false}
# Hypothesis 3 ([Study SI]{.SI})

Individual characteristics that predict lower contributions to the CO programme are associated with a higher likelihood of self-selecting into `Ryanair_choose_noinfo`.
::::

:::: {.callout-note icon=false}
# Hypothesis 4 ([Study SI]{.SI})

Contributions in `Ryanair_choose_info` are higher than contributions in `Ryanair_info`, as individuals with strong environmental concerns tend to self-select into `choose_info`.

Contributions in  `Ryanair_choose_noinfo` are lower than contributions in `Ryanair_noinfo`, as individuals with little environmental concerns tend to self-select into `choose_noinfo`.

## Results {.scrollable}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
# Result 1 ✅

Subjects in `Ryanair_noinfo` contribute significantly more to the CO programme than subjects in `Amazon_noinfo` (two-sided Wilcoxon test p-value < 0.001).

## Wrap-up 

* Monetary transactions related to activities that are clearly perceived as polluting are more likely to be allocated to the same mental account as carbon offsets, resulting in higher offset contributions.

::: {.incremental}

* Individuals with a low pro-environmental orientation tend to strategically ignore information about the emissions associated with their activities, so as to avoid cognitive dissonance and contribute less.

* The choice to actively avoid (seek) information undermines (reinforces) pro-environmental behaviour relative to situations in which information is unavailable (compulsively provided).

<!-- Strategic ignorance intentionally avoids information that can unseat your plans, beliefs, and actions. These are the inconvenient truths that we continually ignore to keep our worlds and modus operandi intact. 
Here’s an example from a non-business setting. For the last decade or so, I know I’ve had elevated blood pressure. I know the risks associated with it becoming high blood pressure. I know regular exercise and a clean diet will reduce my risk. The thing is, I don’t feel the effects of high blood pressure, and it doesn’t impact my day-to-day activities. I consciously choose to read, work and hang out with family over regular exercise and home-cooked meals.
I have a blood pressure cuff that sits by the side of my bed. It takes 30 seconds to slap it on and snag a reading. Yet day after day, I strategically ignore the cuff. I present convenient lies to myself, telling me it’s ok to place masking tape over the yellow warning light on the dashboard. My strategic ignorance serves me in the short term; however, it will cost me dearly in the long term. In this case, it may cost me my life. -->
