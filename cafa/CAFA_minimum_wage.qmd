:::

* [Key result:]{.alert} the introduction of a minimum wage (MW) has a lasting effect on people's reservation wage.
    - The idea: MWs affects workers' perception of what is a [fair]{.alert} transaction. 


## Falk et al. (2006) in a single slide

<br>

* After the introduction of a MW, workersâ€™ reservation wage increases.

* If the MW is removed, workers' reservation wages decrease somewhat, but they are still higher than before the MW.
    - According to Falk et al., this is due to a change in fairness perception.
    - Firms are forced to pay higher wages after the removal of the MW than before its introduction


## Our idea âœ¨

* Sure, fairness matters.

* However, a MW also serves as a [coordination device]{.alert}.

* This is particularly true when wage coordination is difficult and unemployment is high.
    - [The idea:]{.alert} the MW can establish some sort of focal equilibrium.

* Conversely, when the labour market functions smoothly and unemployment is low, the pro-coordination effect of the MW is smaller.


## Tentative research question...

::: {.callout-tip}
#
To what extent are the employment effects of a minimum wage due to changes in the ability to coordinate rather than changes in agents' perception of what is fair?
:::

* [How:]{.alert}
    - Lab experiment
    - We set up different treatments by exogenously varying the scale of agents' payoff function and choice set. <br> ([Conjecture:]{.alert} coordination becomes more difficult as these increase in size.)
    - We examine the differential impact of the introduction and removal of a MW.


## ...and tentative design

* Multiple decision rounds. Subjects play the roles of workers and firms.

* In each period, each firm is randomly matched with three workers.

* Firms have identical revenue functions, with labour as the only input and a decreasing marginal revenue product of labour.

* To hire workers, a firm must submit a wage offer $w$ to the workers.    
    - Wage discrimination is not possible. 


## ...and tentative design (2)

* If a workers accepts the offer, then a contract is concluded.
    -  The worker receives $w$, and the firm's revenue increases according to the marginal revenue generated by the worker.

* Payoff functions are common knowledge. 

* After all decisions in a period are made, both firms and workers are informed about their own payoff and the payoff of other group members.

* The firm is also informed about how many workers accepted its wage offer.


## ...and tentative design (3)

* [Elicitation strategy]{.alert} for reservation wages:
    - In each round, before knowing the firm's wage offer, each worker is asked to indicate the lowest wage they would be willing to accept.
    -  If the wage offer is lower than a worker's acceptance threshold, then the offer is automatically rejected; otherwise it is accepted. 
    - This determines a worker's complete strategy, because the worker implicitly states their accept/reject response to every possible wage offer.


## Payoff functions: baseline

* Firm's payoff function:
$$ 
\pi_{\text{firm}} = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
	& 0\phantom{00 - w} \quad \phantom{22}\text{if no worker is employed} \\
	& 390 - w \quad \phantom{22}\text{if one worker is employed} \\
    & 740 - 2w \quad \phantom{2}\text{if two workers are employed} \\
    & 1000 - 3w \quad \text{if three workers are employed}
\end{aligned} \right.
$$

* Worker's payoff function:
$$ \pi_{\text{worker}} = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
	& 0\phantom{w} \quad \text{if the wage offer is rejected} \\
	& w\phantom{0} \quad \text{if the wage offer is accepted}
\end{aligned} \right.
$$

* Range of possible wage offers: $0 \leq w \leq 1000$

* Conversion rate: 150 tokens = 1 EUR


## Payoff functions: treatment [High]{.trhigh}

* Firm's payoff function:
$$ 
\pi_{\text{firm}}^H = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
	& 0\phantom{00 - w} \quad \phantom{22}\text{if no worker is employed} \\
	& 3900 - w \quad \phantom{22}\text{if one worker is employed} \\
    & 7400 - 2w \quad \phantom{2}\text{if two workers are employed} \\
    & 10000 - 3w \quad \text{if three workers are employed}
\end{aligned} \right.
$$

* Worker's payoff function:
$$ \pi_{\text{worker}}^H = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
	& 0\phantom{w} \quad \text{if the wage offer is rejected} \\
	& w\phantom{0} \quad \text{if the wage offer is accepted}
\end{aligned} \right.
$$

* Range of possible wage offers: $0 \leq w \leq 10000$

* Conversion rate: 1500 tokens = 1 EUR


## Payoff functions: treatment [Low]{.trlow}

* Firm's payoff function:
$$ 
\pi_{\text{firm}}^L = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
	& 0\phantom{0 - w} \quad \phantom{22}\text{if no worker is employed} \\
	& 39 - w \quad \phantom{22}\text{if one worker is employed} \\
    & 74 - 2w \quad \phantom{2}\text{if two workers are employed} \\
    & 100 - 3w \quad \text{if three workers are employed}
\end{aligned} \right.
$$

* Worker's payoff function:
$$ \pi_{\text{worker}}^L = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
	& 0\phantom{w} \quad \text{if the wage offer is rejected} \\
	& w\phantom{0} \quad \text{if the wage offer is accepted}
\end{aligned} \right.
$$

* Range of possible wage offers: $0 \leq w \leq 100$

* Conversion rate: 15 tokens = 1 EUR


## Why these treatments?

* [Conjecture:]{.alert} employment is significantly lower in [High]{.trhigh} than in the baseline, and it is lower in the baseline than in [Low]{.trlow}.       
    - [Our hunch:]{.alert} when the space of possible wage offer and the payoff functions are scaled up, workers' reservation wage and firms' wage offer increase.
    - However, the increase in wage offers is relatively smaller than the increase in reservation wages.
    - Wage offers are costs, while (reservation) wages are revenues. People tend to weigh an increase in costs more than they weigh an increase in revenues by the same percentage.


## Why these treatments? (2)

* If this is true, then the number of cases in which a firm's wage offer is less than a worker's reservation wage will be:     
    (a) Higher in [High]{.trhigh} than in the baseline    
    (b) Higher in the baseline than in [Low]{.trlow}.

* [Question for you:]{.alert} is this a convincing argument? Any reference on this?


## Enter minimum wages

* After a certain number of periods, a MW is introduced. After some other periods, it is removed.  
   - Baseline: MW = 220
   - [High]{.trhigh}: MW = 2200
   - [Low]{.trlow}: MW = 22
   - The choice of when exactly to introduce and remove the MW is still TBD.

* The introduction (removal) of a MW should increase (decrease) employment (this is Falk et al.'s result). 


## Expected results

* When the MW is removed, we should observe an initial miscoordination phase followed by a [transition to a new market equilibrium]{.alert}.

* This new equilibrium might be characterized by a wage lower than the now removed MW. 

* [Conjecture:]{.alert} this is less likely to happen in [High]{.trhigh} than in the baseline, and in the baseline than in [Low]{.trlow}. 


## Expected results (2)

* Our hunch:    
    - If coordination was already a fact before the MW is introduced (which we expect to be more often the case in [Low]{.trlow})...
    - ...and if the pre-MW, equilibrium wage was salient enough...
    - then agents may end up coordinating again on that equilibrium after the MW is removed.

## Expected results (3)

* Our hunch: (cont'd)  
    - Conversely, if before the introduction of the MW coordination was difficult (which we expect to be more often the case in [High]{.trhigh})...
    - ...then the MW should suggest a salient market outcome upon which agents can coordinate...
    - ...which is likely to last even after the MW is removed.

* If this holds true, then the ability of a MW to generate a lasting market equilibrium effect, even subsequent to its removal, is due not only to fairness concerns but also to the extent to which the MW functions as a coordination device.
